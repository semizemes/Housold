# Daily Learning Update

This repository contains the initial files from the Scrimba course. I continue expanding the project with new functionality to practice modern JavaScript concepts through hands-on tasks.

## Concepts I Will Be Working On Today

### JavaScript Essentials

- **import / export**: Using ES modules to organize code and split logic across multiple files.
- **.map()**: Transforming arrays into new arrays based on a callback function.
- **.join()**: Converting arrays into strings, useful for rendering lists and creating formatted output.
- **Object Destructuring**: Extracting values from objects in a clean and readable way.
- **.reduce()**: Reducing an array to a single value, such as totals, counts, or aggregated results.
- **Default Parameters**: Writing functions that provide default values when arguments are missing.

## Purpose of This Repository

This project serves as a continuous learning environment where I apply each new lesson from Scrimba. Every update introduces new code, tasks, or small features built with the concepts I study that day.

## Project Structure

The workspace currently includes:

```
index.css
index.html
index.js
package.json
README.md
vite.config.js
images/
properties/
	placeholderPropertyObj.js
	propertyForSaleArr.js
```

## Getting Started

- **Install dependencies**: If using Vite or additional libraries, run `npm install`.
- **Start dev server**: `npm run dev` (per `vite.config.js`).
- **Edit and experiment**: Most hands-on tasks live in `index.js` and `properties/` modules.
